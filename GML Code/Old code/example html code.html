		<div><h2>Description</h2></div>
			<p>After a particular action is initiated there is a certain amount of time before that action can be initiated again. While this mechanic is most commonly player-driven, there are instances in which the actions of the environment, non-player characters, or some other actor initiates an action which must wait a certain amount of time before that action can be initiated again.</p>
			<p>There are many instances of cooldowns in multiplayer games. In some games, you control units, or heroes, which can cast certain spells only after a certain amount of time has passed since you previously used it. You might have to wait for the cooldown for a high damage spell when you are chasing, or being chased by, an enemy. You might try to make sure your spell is not on cooldown to initiate a timely defense against an encroaching army. In other games you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can throw another grenade.</p>
			<p>The cooldown mechanic has played a big part in creating the kinds of experiences that accompany action games, where time is a factor. It creates a sense of urgency when, for example, you are waiting to fire on the enemy ship with you have 1 HP left and are waiting for your laser beam to be ready, so that you can destroy the enemy ship. The cooldown mechanic is what creates the frustration of not having enough time to defeat an enemy and the pleasure of timing out your play well so that you become the victor.</p>
		<div><h2>Instances</h2></div>
			<div><h3>League of Legends</h3></div>
				<img src="http://www.leagueoflegendscheats.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/League-of-Legends.jpg">
				<p>In League of Legends, each character has a set of spells. Each of these spells help the player, and the player’s team to accomplish their goal of winning the game. Each of the character’s spells vary in strength. Usually, the more powerful spells have a higher cooldown than the weaker spells. This was done in order to make the game balanced and fair. Suppose that character A has a spell that causes 100 damage. Suppose character B has 200 health. It would not be fair, to let character A cast that spell whenever he wants, unless character B has a way to not take that damage. The designers, therefore, would decide to have the spell that character A casts have a high cooldown. This way the player controlling character A has to plan when she is going to cast that spell.</p>
				<p>While it is important, to understand when another character’s powerful spell is on cooldown, that is not the purpose of having cooldowns in the game. The design choice of having cooldowns in the game, unlike the previous example, was made in order to create game balance, in other words game fairness, between the characters in the game. By using cooldowns to create an even playing field, players are more likely to have an enjoyable experience.<p>
				<p>Further still, having cooldowns in the game helps to create that sense of extreme happiness when you start a fight when your opponents strongest spell is on cooldown, as well as frustration when you decide to start a fight when your strongest spell is on cooldown. In both cases, the player is encouraged to play again. The satisfaction of starting a fight when your opponents strongest spell is on cooldown and yours is created from the decision that you made. If someone else was controlling your character you might not have won. However, because you were the one making the decisions and calling the shots, you came out victorious.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, the frustration created when you engaged when you are in an unfavorable cooldown situation is also, usually, your decision as well. You are encouraged to play again because you know that you will not make the same mistake twice. You will make sure to remember how long it was since the last time your opponent used their strongest spell, couple that with your knowledge of how long that spell’s cooldown is, and make a better decision next time.</p>
				<p>The picture above shows a cooldown in effect. You are the character whose portrait is at the bottom left of the screen. At the bottom center of the screen are four buttons. Three of these buttons has a number in it. These numbers indicates how long until those spells are off of cooldown and you can use them again. In League of Legends you are given the cooldown timers of your own character. One thing which separates the good players from the great players is knowledge of your opponent’s cooldown timers.</P>
			<div><h3>Diablo III</h3></div>
				<img src="http://www.gamersbook.com/repository/images/_variations/5/1/51a63111cd031055aa21880519f384b1_lightbox.jpg">
				<p>In Diablo III you play as an adventurer fighting demons. By going through dungeons and fighting larger and more dangerous enemies, you attempt to save the world from the forces of Hell. You find items and level up along your journey to becoming stronger. A big part of the game is finding out how to stay alive when you are being bombarded by hostile forces. One way the game helps you is to make health potions available. Like other games that use health potions, these potions refill your health bar to the maximum, letting you continue to fight for the good of human-kind.</p>
				<p>The designers of Diablo III sought to balance this mechanic with the game by implementing a cooldown feature on the health potions. Not just health potions, mana potions are also victim to this cooldown mechanic. It is only after a certain amount of time after you used a health or mana potion previously that you can use the same one again. However, you don't have to wait for your health potion to be off the cooldown timer to use a mana potion, you can use them at the same time.</p>
				<p>Had this cooldown mechanic not been in the game, your character would most likely become too powerful. If you did not have to wait for your health potion to be off the cooldown timer, you could just constantly be drinking potions in the middle of a big battle and never have to worry about dying. It seems like, instead of having health and mana potions be less common in the Diablo II world, the designers implmented this mechanic instead.</p>
				<p>By having this cooldown mechanic in the game, you have to really think about when you use a mana or health potion. If you take one too early and you are ambushed by a bunch of enemies, you might be out of luck. If you decide to wait for battle to take a potion, you will be walking around the world much weaker than you usually are. This mechanic was implemented in order to create this feeling of risk in the player. Do you take a health potion or do you wait to take a health potion?</p>
			<div><h3>The Sims</h3></div>
				<p>In The Sims you determine what action your character takes. Throughout the course of your gameplay you will, most likely, want to have your character perform an action different from what it is currently doing. In order to change the action of your character you have two options. The first option is to just wait until your character is done with the current action and put the new action in the its action queue. The second option is to click on the action’s box, in the upper left corner of the screen. This will cause an “x” to appear on the action and your character will attempt to back out of the action.</p>
				<p>In either case you have to wait a certain amount of time before your character can do the action you prefer. The case of waiting for your character to finish their current action will take longer than simply clicking on the action and having your character back out of the action. However, having your character back out of an action can have unforeseen consequences. For example, if you back out of a conversation with a friend, your friendship points with that friend may go down. You have to take this into consideration before making your decision to either end the action early or not.</p>
			<div><h3>Super Mario 64</h3></div>
				<p>Unlike the instances mentioned above, there are some instances where the description fits something that you might not expect. In Super Mario 64 you occasionally run into these large blue blocks, depicted in the picture to the right, throughout the course of a level. If you end up underneath the block when it comes down you get injured. Therefore the trick is to time your run so that you run underneath the block when it is on the way up.</p>
				<p>The action initiated is it block smashing itself down to the ground. However, the block cannot constantly smash itself down to the ground, it must wait a certain amount of time to come back up. The time it takes for the block to go back up to its starting point would then be the cooldown. The only way for you to successfully get past these blocks is to run under the block when the ground smash action is on cooldown.</p>
				<p>This requires you to have knowledge of the cooldown time of the block. If, for example, you had never seen the block before and tried to go under it on your first time, you might not be successful. However, if you had seen the block perform its complete action, it going up and down and then back up again, or if you were familiar with similar obstacles, you will probably be successful.</p>

		<div><h2>Notes</h2></div>
				<p>Implementing cooldowns in a player versus player environment can create a competative feeling. The feeling when you enegage in a fight when all of your spells are able to be casted and the most powerful spell of your enemy is not able to be casted feels like having an advantage in a traditional sport and outmaneuvering your opponent.</p>
